In this project, we will be carrying out sentiment analysis on food reviews left by customers on Amazon.com. We will be working with approximately 10,000 reviews and score their positivity, neutrality and negativity scores to identify the overall sentiment of each review.

We will be applying 2 different models - NLTK's VADER and HuggingFace's roBERTa model and compare the results between the 2 to prove the high performance of Transformers.
